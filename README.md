Visualized engagement trends and response metrics.
Derived actionable insights for targeting and strategy refinement.
ðŸŒŸ Key Insights:

Audience segmentation based on behavior significantly improved click-through rates.
ðŸ”— Real-World Application:
From digital ads to email campaigns, A/B testing helps businesses focus their resources where it counts, improving ROI and audience satisfaction. Check out the details and interactive visualizations on GitHub! ðŸš€
